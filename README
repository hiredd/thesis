The following files will be found in this directory:

Makefile		`make' description file for compiling the application
README			this file
flow_final.c		Analyzes and classifies the ECG signal using wqrs as R peak detector
flow_final_sqrs.c	Analyzes and classifies the ECG signal using sqrs as R peak detector
noiseremoval.c		Filters signal at 1-50Hz bandwidth
svmpredict.c		Classifies a single heartbeat
svm.h			Functions and structures used by svmpredict.c are declared in this header file
svm.o			Object file (of svm.cpp - not included here) needed for svmpredict.c to be linked with 
model.h			Just another header file
script.py		Script to run the application with different inputs
configs			Folder containing configurations regarding the feature vector and the corresponding svm model
data			Folder containing ECG signal records
res			Folder to store results

'flow_final' Usage: flow_final configs/config_i.txt res/confi_output1.txt res/confi_output2.txt data/data_i.txt configs/model_config_i.txt

configs/config_i.txt		is the feature vector configuration
res/confi_output1.txt		is the stored output regarding the filtering and segmentation stage execution times
res/confi_output2.txt		is the stored output regarding the feature extraction and classification stage execution times
data/data_i.txt			is the inputed ECG signal
configs/model_config_i.txt	is the inputed svm model which corresponds to the feature vector configurations
